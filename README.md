Description: The application will allow students at UCLA to schedule games and check the availability of various basketball courts around campus. This would include Hitch courts and the John Wooden Center. Based on the John Wooden Center and Hitch courts’ hours of operation, students will be able to create blocks where they can ‘reserve’ courts and verify what courts are currently in use.
